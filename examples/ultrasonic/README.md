An ultrasonic distance sensor is a device that uses ultrasonic waves to measure the distance between the sensor and an object. It consists of a transmitter that emits a high-frequency sound wave and a receiver that detects the wave after it has bounced off the object.

The basic principle behind an ultrasonic distance sensor is that the time it takes for the sound wave to travel from the transmitter to the object and back to the receiver can be used to calculate the distance to the object. This is known as time-of-flight measurement.

When the ultrasonic wave is emitted, it travels through the air at a constant speed until it reaches an object. The wave then bounces off the object and travels back to the receiver. By measuring the time it takes for the wave to travel back and forth, the distance to the object can be calculated using the speed of sound.
(drawback is that speed of sound isn't homogeneous)

### Example 

Example reads distance 4 times every few seconds and displays calculations with different units.
