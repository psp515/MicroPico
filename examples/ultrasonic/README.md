Ultrsonic uses frequencies above the human ear's audibility limit to measure distance. If wave reflects from obstacle it returns back to the sensor and we have our distance. If there is no obstacle or distance is bigger than aprox. 4.5m-5m we have unsuccesfull measurement.

### Example 

Example reads distance 4 times every few seconds and displays calculations with different units.
