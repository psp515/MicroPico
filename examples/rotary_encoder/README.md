A rotary encoder is a type of electro-mechanical device that is used to convert the angular position or motion of a shaft 
or axle to an analog or digital signal. It is also known as a shaft encoder or rotary pulse generator.

There are variable realisatios of such an encoder like:
- optical
- Mechanical
- On-Axis Magnetic
- Off-Axis Magnetic.

In this example we are using a mechanical encoder with 20 steps per 360 degrees and with button.
(ex. similar encoder is used in creality ender 3 / 5 display)

### Example 

Example contains only rotary encoder with button. When clicked or rotated it shows action that occured.
If rotation occurred, also displays position of encoder.
