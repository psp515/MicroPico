 It is a three-terminal device that can be used to adjust the resistance in a circuit, allowing for the control of the current flowing through it. Potentiometers are often used as volume controls on audio equipment, and as position sensors in robotic applications. They can also be used to adjust the brightness of a light or the speed of a motor. Potentiometer have a mechanical component that allows to adjust the resistance by rotating a knob or sliding a lever.
