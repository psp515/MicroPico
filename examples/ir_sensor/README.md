IR sensor is created to detect changes of IR wave, emitted by all warm objects, including the human body, and are 
often used in applications such as remote controls, heat sensing cameras, and security systems. 
They are also used in many industrial and scientific applications, such as spectroscopy and temperature measurement.

Passive Infrared sensors (PIR) sensors detect changes in infrared radiation in their field of view,
which is emitted by warm objects, including people and animals. When a warm body moves in the sensor's field of view 
it triggers an alarm.

Break beam sensors, work by using a beam of light that is broken when an object or person passes through it. 
The sensor consists of two parts, a transmitter and a receiver (diodes). When the beam is broken, the sensor triggers an alarm.

### IR Sensor Example

Example displays data in terminal when movement occurs and then turns on led for 1 second.
(Made for Break Beam sensor and PIR sensor, differs in one line)

### IR Sensor Interrupt Example

Example displays data in terminal when movement occurs and then turns on led for 1 second.
(Common for PIR and Break Beam)

#### Schema

Common schema for both examples.
