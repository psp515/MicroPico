Light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor device that emits light when current flows through it. Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons. The color of the light (corresponding to the energy of the photons) is determined by the energy required for electrons to cross the band gap of the semiconductor (led can produce visible, infrared and uv waves)(beam break ir sensor is a example of use a infrared diode).

### Example 1

Example shows how on, off and blink works for led.

### Example 3

Example shows how on, off and blink works for pwm led.

#### Schema 

Common schema for example 1 and 3

### Example 2

Example uses photorezistor. Reads value from photorezistor then changes led brigntness.
