Photoresistor, also known as a light-dependent resistor (LDR), is a type of resistor whose resistance changes based on the amount of light it is exposed to. Photoresistors are made of a semiconductor material, typically cadmium sulfide (CdS), which allows them to change resistance in response to changes in light intensity. Photoresistors can be used in a wide range of applications, including light-sensitive controls, automatic lighting systems, and optical sensors. They are also widely used in burglar alarms, street lighting, and other security systems.
