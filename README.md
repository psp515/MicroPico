### About The Project

Project is created in order to get acquainted with microcontrollers programming and some basics IOT.
<br/>
This repository will contain code with usage exaples (with example connections) for different elements (lcd, keyboards, etc.).
Most examples will be created with micropython, yet examples with c/c++ might occur.
<br/>
Also each example contains short element and example description.

Also in futre I am planning to create few project based on knowledge gained here. (Links will be added when they appear)

### Getting Started

To use this project simply download the [ThonnyIDE](https://thonny.org/) and this repository.
<br/>
Of course you need to have any Raspberry Pi Pico board (with micropython) and element you want to check.
(In order to use it on Raspberry Pi some functions may need some slight fixes)

With thonny IDE open Micropico project and upload src folder and micropico.py to your raspberry pi pico, and you are ready to run some examples.

### Roadmap

Roadmap shows elements to be added / that are ready to use with usage examples. Elements split in 2 categories Pooling and Interrupts (I thinks most elements could be in both category but for some elements it is worthless). 

#### Pooling

Polling periodically checks if device needs attention. This can be done in a sequential manner or in a priority-based manner (if some devices are more important).

Element  | Lib Code | Example | Schema | Tested
:-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:
Led | ✅  | ✅  | ✅ | ✅
RGB Led | ✅  | ✅ | ✅ | ✅
Keypad | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |✅
PIR / IR Break Sensor | ✅  | ✅ | ✅ | ✅
Button | ✅  | ✅ | ✅ | ✅
Potentiometer | ✅  | ✅ | ✅ | ✅
Photoresistor  | ✅  | ✅ | ✅ | ✅
Ultrasonic | ✅  | ✅ | ✅ | ✅
DHT11 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅
Rotary Encoder | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅
I2C LCD | ❌  | ❌ | ❌ | ❌

#### Interrupts

Interrupts alert CPU when a device needs attention, causing the CPU to pause its current task, handle the interrupt request, and then resume the original task.

Element  | Lib Code | Example | Schema | Tested
:-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:
Button | ✅  | ✅ | ✅ | ✅
PIR / IR Break Sensor | ✅  | ✅ | ✅ | ✅
Rotary Encoder | ❌  | ❌ | ❌ | ❌
NEC IR | ✅  | ✅ | ✅ | ✅

See the [open issues](https://github.com/psp515/MicroPico/issues) for a full list of tasks (and known issues).
